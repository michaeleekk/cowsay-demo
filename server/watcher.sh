# Watches for .go file changes in the project directory, telling the server to
# restart whenever a change is detected. Should be run outside the docker
# container, because file system events are not properly detected inside the
# boot2docker VM: https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/688
#
# Requires fswatch which can be installed with brew.
#
# This works by opening a tcp connection on $RESET_PORT and sending a few bytes
# (the actual message doesn't matter). If the API was started with
# docker-compose, the autoreloader will be running inside the container and
# waiting on $RESET_PORT for a connection.
